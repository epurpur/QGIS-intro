# UVA Scholar's Lab
  
  -https://scholarslab.org/
  
  -Offer GIS services specifically (but potentially not limited to) Humanities/Social Sciences
  
  -ESRI/ArcGIS Only
  

# What are we doing today?
  -GIS Overview
  
  -QGIS Overview
  
  -QGIS Hands-On 
  
  -QGIS self help + self guided learning
  
 
# Limitations of this workshop
  
  -limited amount of time
  
  -not specific to your needs
  

# GIS in a nutshell
  
  -Geographic Information Systems. GIS is an acronym.
  
  -A computer system capable of assembling, storing, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced 
  information
  
  My Own Definition: GIS is a data visualization tool used for analyzing spatial relationships and patterns between objects.
  You can discover and communicate meaningful patterns in your data.
  
   -The output is usually a map but the power lies in the data behind the image
  
   -GIS skills are a literacy. You won't be a master after today's workshop (unfortunately)
  

# QGIS - A quick and dirty overview
  - Free and Open Source GIS software!
  
  - Similar to R in many ways. Has become a viable alternative to ESRI
  
  - Gary Sherman: The Godfather - https://www.xyht.com/spatial-itgis/godfather-of-qgis/
  
  - Started in early 2000s as "Quantum GIS". Now just QGIS.
  
  - Large user community internationally
  
  - QGIS homepage : https://qgis.org/en/site/
    
      - If you haven't installed yet, go to this link and download
    

# Other Open Source or Free GIS tools
  - GRASS GIS
    
      - popular for academics because it is easy to include code in publications
    
      - QGIS started as a GUI interface to GRASS GIS
  
  - IDRISI
    
      - for really high level raster image processing
  
  - Smallworld by General Electric
    
      - specifically tailored to utility companies
  
  - Google Earth / Google Maps / Google MyMap
    
      - if you just need to show where stuff is
  
  - R
    
      - for data scientists. Provides some publication quality graphing and mapping functionality
    
    
# Why Use QGIS?
  
  - Because it's free
  
  - Linux and Mac Compatible
    
      - ArcGIS is Windows/PC only
  
  - Because you are a fan of open source or a developer
    
      - Customize it the way you like
  
  - Maybe you are an ESRI hater?
  
  
# What can you do with it?
  
  - Most of the things you can do with ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro
  
  - Use the same file types as ArcGIS
  
  - Build your own tools or customize it
  

# What can't you do with it?
  
  - No ArcGIS online equivalent
  
  - No user help line
  
  - Probably lacking some high end functionality
  
 
# Time to get out hands dirty!
  
  - We are going to use publicly available data from the City of Charlottesville, plus some of my own
  
  - Go Here for the data: https://virginia.box.com/s/3rsj94k7a9yymgf7429skdpml9c1pcvn
  
  
# Hands On steps

  - Load the data, including basemap
  
  - Basic navigation, various panels and dialog boxes
  
  - Identify Tool
  
  - Attribute Tables
  
  - Vector data types (Point, Line, Polygon)
  
  - Selections (click on some, draw a box, select by expression, select by location)
  
      - make new layer from selection
  
  - Geometry Tools (buffer, clip)
  
  - Symbology
  
  - Raster Data Types
  
       - Raster Calculator
       
  - Cartography (Print Composer)
  
  - Plugins
  
  - Coordinate Systems
